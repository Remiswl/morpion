## Description
Create and improve a tic-tac-toe to train on React (Create React App).

In addition to the tutorial, I'll improve the game adding the following options:

* Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
* Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
* When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.


## Technologies
* Front-end language: JavaScript
* Framework: React.js 17.0.1
